# My Data Science Tutorial- Blog
Hi! My name is Josh. I was born and raised in the beautiful Puerto Rico island and I'm a PeopleSoft Programmer Analyst with almost 10 years of overall experience. I've worked with Human Resources, Financials, and Campus Solutions' systems. I hold a Masters' Degree in Management of Information Systems. 

I created this Githug account on 11/04/2020 for the purpose of tracking my Data Science learning progress so I can, potentially, hold a gig as a Data Scientist one day. Feel free to take a look around at my progress, comment on it, and wish me luck!

Thanks!
-Josh
